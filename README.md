### Rust [![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=rust)](https://skillicons.dev)
Rust is a multi-paradigm, general-purpose programming language. Rust emphasizes performance, type safety, and concurrency. Rust enforces memory safety - that is, that all references point to valid memory - without requiring the use of a garbage collector or reference counting present in other memory-safe languages. To simultaneously enforce memory safety and prevent concurrent data races, Rust's borrow checker tracks the object lifetime and variable scope of all references in a program during compilation. Rust is popular for systems programming but also offers high-level features including functional programming constructs.

Software developer Graydon Hoare created Rust as a personal project while working at Mozilla Research in 2006. Mozilla officially sponsored the project in 2009. Rust's major influences include SML, OCaml, C++, Cyclone, Haskell, and Erlang. Since the first stable release in January 2014, Rust has been adopted by companies including Amazon, Discord, Dropbox, Facebook (Meta), Google (Alphabet), and Microsoft.

#### Characteristics of Rust
- Performance comparable to C and C++
- Memory safety
- Developed with satefy in mind
- Reliable
- Probably the most useful compiler messages of all languages
- Free and Open Source
- Hard learning curve
- Not exactly beginner friendly
- Has decent future in gamedev
- The most loved programming language
